## DATA621_HW2

In this homework assignment, you will work through various classification metrics. You will be asked to create
functions in R to carry out the various calculations. You will also investigate some functions in packages that will let
you obtain the equivalent results. Finally, you will create graphical output that also can be used to evaluate the
output of classification models, such as binary logistic regression.


```{r }

# Download the classification output data set
data1 <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/baruab/DATA-621/main/classification-output-data.csv", header=TRUE, stringsAsFactors=FALSE)
head(data1)

class(data1)
dim(data1)

# select variables class, scored.class, scored.probability
keycolumns <- c("class", "scored.class", "scored.probability")
newdata <- data1[keycolumns]

dim(newdata)

head(newdata)
```


## Seems like dependent variable 'class' was regressed against several independent variables. 'Scored.Class' is the predicted variable and probability of being in class of 1 is denoted by 'scored.probability'



```{r}
#calculate frequency table for class 
table(newdata$class, dnn="Class") %>% kable() # %>% kable_styling()



```


## Predicted Class Frequency table
```{r}
#calculate frequency table for scored.class 
table(newdata$scored.class, dnn="Predicted Class") %>% kable()

```


## Raw Confusion matrix for the scored dataset representing Predicted and Actual values
```{r}
table(newdata$class, newdata$scored.class, 
      dnn = c("Actual", "Predicted"))  %>% kable() 
```


## True Positive (TP) where Actual value and Predicted values are 1 (27)
## True Negative (TN) where Actual value and Predicted values are 0 (119)
## False Positive (FP) where Actual value is 0 and Predicted value is 1 (5)
## False Negative (FN) where Actual value is 1 and Predicted value is 0 (30)


## Write a function that takes the data set as a dataframe, with actual and predicted classifications identified, and returns the accuracy of the predictions
```{r}



```
